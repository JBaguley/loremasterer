# The Loremasterer
Story Development and Tracker for Novels

## What is it?
Loremasterer is an in development open source program to manage characters, story and plot for budding novellists.
Spurred on by personal experience of a true lack of beautiful UI apps in specialist areas such as this, Loremasterer is designed to be functional, yet designed to be incredibly usable and eyecatching.

## Where is it in development?
Currently Loremasterer is in very early stages of development and is not yet functional, but watch this space!
